# ‚úî Git Hooks 

Git hooks are scripts or programs that can be executed automatically by Git at specific points in the version control workflow. They allow you to enforce certain policies, perform automated checks, or trigger custom actions before or after certain Git events, such as committing code, pushing changes, merging branches, and more.
Git hooks are located in the .git/hooks directory of your Git repository. 

Each hook is a shell script or executable program with a predefined name. When you initialize a new Git repository, it comes with a set of sample hooks that are named with a .sample extension. To use them, you need to remove the .sample extension from the hooks file if you want to enable custom actions.

#
# üîπ Pre-commit hook
This hook runs before a commit is created. It allows you to perform pre-commit checks such as linting, code formatting, or running unit tests to ensure that code meets certain quality standards before being committed. Here we have used to validate branch name.


#
# üîπ Prepare-commit-msg
This hook is particularly useful for adding or modifying information in the commit message just before the user is prompted to edit it. Here we use to validate commit message.
