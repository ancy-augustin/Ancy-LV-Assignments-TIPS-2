If the build fails due to windows execution policy, then follow the link below to remove the restrictions. Useful Links: 
[About ExecutionPolicy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.3) and 
[Set-ExecutionPolicy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/set-executionpolicy?view=powershell-7.3) --> Set this as UNRESTRICTED.
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted --> Type this by running PowerShell by giving Run as Administrator

After successfully connecting to GitHub, we can run the workflow manually by clicking RUN WORKFLOW or set a TRIGGER in the YAML (.yml) file when there is a PR or Push to the main/master branch.  

A mail will be sent to the mail id of the GitHub account when the build fails by default.
